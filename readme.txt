= How do I delete the WP_CACHE define from wp-config.php? =
Load your desktop ftp client and connect to your site. Navigate to the root (or the directory below it) of your site where you'll find wp-config.php. Download that file and edit it in a text editor. Delete the line define( 'WP_CACHE', true ); and save the file. Now upload it, overwriting the wp-config.php on your server.
